# Integration of Classical Features, Social Media Response and Power of Stars to Predict the Box Office Sales  
In this project, we have attempted to predict the box office success of a movie by integrating classical features, social media factors and influence of the stars. Our model produced an accuracy of 81.39% with 10-fold cross validation on a dataset of 95 movies from the 2015 - 2016 timeframe.
